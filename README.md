# Plan Better Amid Conservatism: Offline Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with Actor Rectification

This repository is the implementation of [Plan Better Amid Conservatism: Offline Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with Actor Rectification](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v162/pan22a/pan22a.pdf) in ICML 2022. This codebase is based on the open-source [maddpg-pytorch](https://github.com/shariqiqbal2810/maddpg-pytorch) framework, and please refer to that repo for more documentation.

## Requirements

- Multi-agent Particle Environments: in envs/multiagent-particle-envs and install it by `pip install -e .`
- python: 3.6
- torch
- baselines (https://github.com/openai/baselines)
- seaborn
- gym==0.9.4
- Multi-Agent MuJoCo: Please check the [multiagent_mujoco](https://github.com/schroederdewitt/multiagent_mujoco) repo for more details about the environment. Note that this depends on gym with version 0.10.5.
